    worked example with IMDB databse
 - Read and write a file (S3.1)                 [5 min]
 - Pandas basics                                [15 min]
    - series 
    - dataframe
        - Understanding columns as series
    - explore a dataframe (S3.4)
        - shape, columns,
        - unique(), dropna(), fillna()
 - Pandas to do useful things
    - Add a simple column (S3.5)                [5 min]
        - As a new thing
        - As a sum/subtract

        - sum(), count(), description()
    - Apply a function to a column (S3.7)       [*]
        - *Using a lambda function
        - Using a predefined function
    - Link data (S3.6)                          [*]
        - Concatenate, merge, join 
C. Crazy fun with Pandas                        [**]
